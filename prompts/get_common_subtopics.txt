You are working with GCSE {subject} content for the {examiner} exam board.

You are given:
List A: subtopics gathered from past paper questions
List B: subtopics taken from the official specification

Your task:
Identify which subtopics from List B are clearly represented in List A, either through exact matches or close similarity in ideas or wording.
Focus primarily on List B — your goal is to check which of its subtopics are covered by past paper content (List A), even if the phrasing is different.
Do not include any subtopic from List B if it is clearly not present or referenced in any form in List A.

Instructions:
Return your output as a JSON list of strings.
Only include subtopics from List B that are reflected in List A through direct match or closely similar content.
Do not include anything not present or reasonably implied by both lists.
Do not add any explanations or formatting — return only the raw JSON list.
DO NOT RETURN ANYTHING NOT IN LIST B - EVEN THE WORDING MUST BE EXACT

Here is the data:
List A (past paper subtopics):
{subtopics_from_questions}

List B (specification subtopics):
{list_spec_subtopics}
